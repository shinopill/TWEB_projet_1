## What is Github Soulmate ?
Github Soulmate is an app that compares two users of Github in order to see if they can work well together  

## How do i test the app ?

You can go on https://murmuring-thicket-89610.herokuapp.com/ and try it online.

Or you can clone the repo and do the following things : 

run the commande 'npm install ' in shell at the root folder of the app. 
Create a .env file and copy the .env.default file. 
After that you have to creat an access token in you Github account ('https://murmuring-thicket-89610.herokuapp.com/') 
Change the XXX with you token 
then run : 'npm start ' 

It will launch the app on the localhost:3000
